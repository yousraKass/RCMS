# RCMS
 The restaurant chain management system (RCMS) is a system developed for Koul 
Hani’s company that operates and franchises thousands of restaurants throughout the 
country. Each restaurant has 5 cuisines (Algerian, Syrian, Chinese, European and 
Indian).
 Everyday the restaurant will have a total sale (distributed on its five cuisines) and a total 
cost that includes rent (brought to a daily amount from the monthly rent), employees’ 
payments, electricity, gas, vegetables, meats, other ingredients and publicity spending.
 Each cuisine has a rating that is calculated monthly based on the rating of the 
customers who visited that specific cuisine of that specific restaurant.
 Also, there is a national prize given monthly to the restaurant with the best 
performance (the prize is for each cuisine and a restaurant can get it in more than 
cuisine) The amount of prize is calculated as the following: Amount_of_Prize=monthly 
sales+ (x/100): where x is the monthly rating of the specific cuisine This amount is 
cumulative month by month (it means that each month we add the Amout_of_Prize of 
the previous month)
 The system can calculate the ratio of the monthly sales on publicity: Ratio_Sales_Pub= 
monthlySales/monthly_Pub
 This RCMS must store the following data:
 The information about each restaurant as explained by the company
 The total daily sales as well as the distribution of this total over the 5 food 
cuisines
 The daily costs of any given restaurant
 The daily average amount spent on publicity
 The ratings a restaurant gets for its different cuisines.
 For the purpose to display the following results:
 A report on the sales of any restaurant on any month. 
 A listing summarising all the sales of all the restaurants of any specified 
district or city or Wilaya or even the whole country. 
 The prize winners for the 5 cuisines on any month.
 A listing summarising the ratio of the monthly sales to the amount of money 
spent during any given month on publicity for any specified restaurant or city 
or Wilaya or even the whole country. 
 The previous results for a given month, year, or even period (from a start date 
to an end date).
